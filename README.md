# VGM Player for RC2014 Z80 Computer

A player for VGM files ported to the RC2014 Z80 computer.

**This is a port of the original VGM player for Amstrad CPC to work with RC2014 systems.**

## Credits

**Original Authors**: Shinra team - PulkoMandy, OffseT and Zik  
**Original Project**: https://framagit.org/shinra/vgmplay  
**RC2014 Port**: jduraes

## RC2014 Port Status

✅ **Complete** - Successfully ported and builds with sjasmplus

## Building

Requires [sjasmplus](https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus) assembler:

```bash
make            # Build VGMPLAY.COM
make clean      # Clean build files
make test       # Build and show file info
```

## Usage

Copy `VGMPLAY.COM` to your RC2014 CP/M system and run:

```
A>VGMPLAY MUSIC.VGM
```

**Note**: Uses 8.3 filename convention (VGMPLAY.COM, MUSIC.VGM) for CP/M compatibility.

## Hardware Requirements

- RC2014 Z80 system with CP/M 2.2+
- OPL3 sound card at I/O ports 0x60-0x63
- AY-3-8912 sound card at I/O ports 0xA0-0xA1
- Uncompressed VGM files

## I/O Port Assignments

Chosen to avoid conflicts with common RC2014 peripherals:

| Chip | Function | Port |
|------|----------|------|
| OPL3 Page 1 | Register | 0x60 |
| OPL3 Page 1 | Data | 0x61 |
| OPL3 Page 2 | Register | 0x62 |
| OPL3 Page 2 | Data | 0x63 |
| AY-3-8912 | Register | 0xA0 |
| AY-3-8912 | Data | 0xA1 |

**Avoided Ports:**
- 0x80-0x87 (Serial SIO)
- 0x10-0x17 (CF Card)  
- 0x70-0x73 (RTC)
- 0x00-0x07 (Digital I/O)
- 0x78-0x7B (Memory banking)

## Supported VGM Commands

- 5A - Write to OPL2 register
- 5B - Write to OPL1 register
- 5E - Write to OPL3 register in bank 1
- 5F - Write to OPL3 register in bank 2
- 61 - Variable delay
- 62 - 1/60s delay
- 63 - 1/50s delay
- 66 - End of stream
- 70 to 7F - Short variable delay
- A0 - Write to AY3 register

## Controls

- **ESC** - Exit player
- Player automatically loops when reaching end of stream

## Technical Notes

- Built as CP/M .COM file (669 bytes)
- Uses CP/M BDOS calls for file I/O and console
- Direct I/O port access for sound chips
- Simplified timing suitable for RC2014 systems
- 128-byte file buffer for memory efficiency

## Original Description

This can play OPL1, OPL2 and OPL3 musics (YM3256, YM3812, YMF262) through the
OPL3LPT. It can also play AY music.

Some other musics can be used with the help of [vgm-conv](https://github.com/digital-sound-antiques/vgm-conv),
which can convert them to the supported ones. This allows for example to play
music from the MSX2 (normally using OPN2 + AY) on the OPL3.

With a bit more creativity (running old DOS tools in DosBox and capturing the
resulting register dumps) it is also possible to convert a few other formats
(Midi, SID, ...) for use with the OPL3.

The timing is synchronized on the CPC vertical blanking (50Hz) or on the interrupts
(300Hz). This is much less precise than the timing of the VGM files (44100Hz),
but seems good enough to play most sounds. Use of the Amstrad Plus raster interrupt
may allow for more precision. Unfortunately, AY lists can be used only with the
AY, no other soundchip can enjoy the DMA capabilities. The code rounds down the
waiting to the previous interrupt, but accumulates the error and adds it to later
delays. Since VGM files are usually generated by dumping the data from running
code, there will often be a lot of small delays between register writes. These
could probably be ignored to optimize things a bit. However, this is probably
easier to do in a pre-processing step rather than in the Z80 player. I will let
you experiment with the VGM format if you want to do such things.

Currently there is no compression of the VGM files. I don't want to implement a
full gzip decompressor so I need to figure out something simpler that can be
used as a stream easily (to unpack a few frames ahead, complete songs usually won't
fit in memory otherwise).

The header is also blindly skipped. This will create problems on early versions
of VGM files which have a smaller header, or later ones which have a larger one.

To maximize memory space usage, the player currently is loaded with the LD RSX
from the Arkos ROM (but can be adjusted to use LOAD from Utopia as well). It's
possible to play files up to about 38K, above that, some important things in
memory are overwritten and you get a crash and no music. Of course this could be
easily raised to 63K or so using the banks (or more if implementing bank switching
during replay, I guess?)

Unsupported commands in the VGM data are printed as ASCII chars. If something
is printed and the music is not sounding correctly, probably your file uses
not implemented commands.

## RC2014 Adaptations Made

- ✅ Adapt CPC-specific BIOS calls to CP/M BDOS calls
- ✅ Update I/O port addresses for RC2014 sound cards
- ✅ Modify timing routines for RC2014/CP/M environment
- ✅ Convert to 8.3 filename convention
- ✅ Create sjasmplus build system
- ✅ Test build and fix assembly errors

Ready for hardware testing!
